This is the fastest way to get a chat into WhatStats. It keeps the file small, the import quick, and your data on-device.

## The short version

1. Open a chat in WhatsApp.
2. Tap the menu and choose **Export Chat**.
3. Pick **Without Media**.
4. Share the file to **WhatStats**.

That is it. The app will detect the file, extract it if needed, and you are ready to analyze.

## Why "Without Media"?

Media makes exports huge and slow. WhatStats only needs the text to build the analytics, so skipping media keeps everything fast and reliable.

## If you do not see WhatStats in the share sheet

Tap **More** in the share sheet and enable WhatStats in the list. Once it is enabled, it will show up every time.

That is the whole import flow. Simple, private, and fast.
