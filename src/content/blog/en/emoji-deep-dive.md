The deep dive view is the most detailed emoji breakdown in the app. It is where you go when you want to answer *why* someone feels a certain way in a chat, not just *that* they do.

## What it analyzes

- **Emoji mood distribution** (happy, sad, excited, etc.)
- **Diversity score** (do they use a wide set or the same few?)
- **Top emojis and categories**
- A quick personality read based on usage patterns

It is not psychology - it is just a clean summary of how someone communicates.

## When it is useful

- You want to compare two people side by side
- You are curious if someone has a consistent emoji "signature"
- You want a more detailed read than the overview screen

## A quick example

If someone sends 200 emojis but only uses three, their diversity score will be low. If someone uses a wide range, you will see it instantly. That is the difference this screen is built to surface.

## The takeaway

Emoji deep dive is for people who want the extra layer of context. It is a fun breakdown, but it is also surprisingly accurate in how it reflects real chat habits.
