The home screen is the control center. It is where all your imported chats live, and it is designed to stay simple even if you analyze a lot of them.

## What you can do here

- See every imported chat at a glance
- Jump into analysis with one tap
- Delete a chat and clean up storage

I kept the layout intentionally clean so the stats are never buried.
