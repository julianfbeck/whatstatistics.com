If you want a Spotify-Wrapped style recap for WhatsApp, you already can. I built Chat Wrapped in WhatStats to do exactly that: take a text export and turn it into a story.

This is the short, practical version of how to do it.

## 1) Export your chat (without media)

WhatsApp export is the input. The key is choosing **Without Media** so the file stays small and fast.

## 2) Share it to WhatStats

Once exported, share the file to WhatStats. The app extracts the chat and prepares it for analysis locally on your device.

If you have never done this, onboarding shows the exact flow:

## 3) Open Chat Wrapped

Inside the chat, tap **Chat Wrapped**. You will get a story-style recap with the big moments first and the deeper patterns after.

The flow covers things like totals, activity peaks, conversation dynamics, and emoji personality. It is fast and visual by design.

## 4) Share it as an image (or video)

When the recap looks good, export it. You can generate a single image or a full story video.

## Why this is different

Everything runs locally. Your chats do not leave your phone. No servers. No uploads.

That is the whole point: a fun recap without giving your messages away.

## The quick summary

- Export chat without media
- Share to WhatStats
- Open Chat Wrapped
- Export and share

That is it. A Spotify-Wrapped style story, but for your WhatsApp chats.
