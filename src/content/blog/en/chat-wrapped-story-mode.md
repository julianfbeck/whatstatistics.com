If you have a big chat history, a wall of numbers doesn't help much. I wanted a way to *feel* the story, not just read the stats. That's why **Chat Wrapped** exists.

It's the story mode inside WhatStats. It takes your WhatsApp export and turns it into a clean, swipeable recap you can fly through in seconds -- or share as an image/video when it actually looks good.

## Why a story view?

Because context matters. Your chat isn't a spreadsheet. It's bursts of conversations, emoji spikes, late-night chaos, and those "why were we texting at 2 AM?" moments.

Chat Wrapped puts that into a flow:

- **High-level highlights** first (message totals, activity peaks)
- **Human moments** next (who starts chats, who replies fastest, who ghosts)
- **Personality & emoji layers** at the end

It feels like a recap, not a report.

## What you'll see in the story

The exact cards vary by chat size, but the core arc is consistent:

- **Total messages + timeline spikes**
- **Most active people and days**
- **Conversation dynamics** (starters, response time, ghosting)
- **Emoji trends and moods**
- **Relationship patterns** (the duo that talks most, the one-sided convos)

Here's a peek at the flow:

And the deeper personality/emojis section:

## Private by design

This is important: **everything runs locally on your device**. No uploads. No servers. Your chats stay on your phone, always.

That means you get the recap, without giving your messages to anyone else.

## Sharing without the cringe

Once the story is done, you can export it as:

- **A single image** (perfect for a quick share)
- **A full video** of the story

Image preview looks like this:

## How to try it

1. Export a WhatsApp chat **without media**
2. Share it to WhatStats
3. Open the chat and tap **Chat Wrapped**

If you've never seen it before, the onboarding shows you exactly where it is:

## The point

Chat Wrapped is what I wish I had for my own chats: fast, visual, and actually fun. It's not trying to overanalyze -- it just shows you the story you already lived.

If you want the full flow (including exports and all story cards), grab the app and try it on a chat you care about.
