I made onboarding short on purpose. It is just enough to show you where everything is without slowing you down.

## What it covers

- The core feature highlights
- Where to find Chat Wrapped
- How to export and import a chat

## Why it matters

The app is simple once you know where to tap. The onboarding is there to make sure you hit the ground running.

If you skipped it, you can replay it from Settings anytime.
