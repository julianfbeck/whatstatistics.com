This view answers one simple question: **who is carrying the emoji energy in this chat?**

The overall emoji vibe is fun, but the per-person breakdown is where it gets personal. You can see who is expressive, who is minimal, and who is straight-up chaotic.

## What you get here

- Each person's **top emojis**
- **Total emoji count** per person
- A visual sense of who is the most expressive

If you are in a group chat, this screen usually reveals one or two people who are doing all the work.

## Why it matters

Emoji usage is a personality signal. Some people reply with full sentences, others speak in three emojis and a thumbs up. This view makes those styles obvious at a glance.

It is also a quick way to settle debates like:

- Who sends the most emojis?
- Who always uses the same ones?
- Who never uses emojis at all?

## The takeaway

This is the most fun way to map personalities in a chat. It is simple, visual, and always surprising.
