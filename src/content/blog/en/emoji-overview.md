Emoji overview is the fastest way to understand the tone of a chat. It is not about a single message - it is about the *pattern* across weeks or months.

When I open this screen, I want two things immediately:

- Which emojis define the chat
- How expressive the chat really is

That is exactly what this view gives you, without any extra noise.

## What it shows

- **Top emojis** across the entire chat
- **Total emoji volume** so you can see how expressive the group is
- A quick snapshot of the overall vibe

If you are comparing chats, this view tells you more in five seconds than a full list of messages ever could.

## Why it is useful

Emoji usage is the emotional layer of a conversation. Some chats are all business. Others are pure chaos. The overview makes that difference obvious.

It is also a good entry point if you want to go deeper. From here, you can jump into per-person emoji stats and see who is driving the vibe.

## The takeaway

If you only check one emoji screen, make it this one. It is the cleanest, fastest summary of how your chat *feels*.
